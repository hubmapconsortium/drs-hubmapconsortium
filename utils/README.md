This script requires that you add a Globus token to the config.json. 
It also assumes that the user/password combination for database access, has write privileges.

Of note, if you do not use the `--execute` flag, the script will only generate the files and queries that should be used for insertion. If you do set the flag, it will perform the inserts itself.
